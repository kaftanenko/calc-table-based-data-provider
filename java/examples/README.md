# Examples

The Examples sub-project demonstrates how the "Calc Table (based) Data Provider" framework can be applied within your development processes.

The Examples embrace at the moment the following fields of application:

- [dict](./dict/): integration of the dictionary data into the project's source code
- [test-data](./test-data): test data provider applicable within the unit/integration tests
- [test scenarios](./test-scenarios): executable data driven test scenarios specified through domain area experts

Each of the given Examples shows often only one of many other possible application scenarios. It is up to you as a framework end-user to figure out, how the new possibilities can be best applied within your own projects.
